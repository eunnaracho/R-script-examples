## Delta delta Ct method
This script was first written as an exercise in utilizing basic R packages (i.e., tidyverse) and exploring different statements (e.g. if, elseif, while). It was written to accommodate qPCR data from multiple experiments, each with a different set of controls for normalization.
The script is currently in use for quickly processing qPCR data and visualizing fold changes in gene expression.
